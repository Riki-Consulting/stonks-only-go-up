# Stonks only go up

Anyone with half a brain knows that meme stonks are the next big thing, this project hopes to uncover those so we can all ignore logical financial advice and make some money

## Backend

Where the magic happens, basic premise, grab thought provoking financial insights from distinguished feeds such as:

- [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets)
- [u/deepfuckingvalue](https://www.reddit.com/u/deepfuckingvalue)

Chuck em in firestore or mongoDB or some other place I don't care.

AI (lol) models to find "sentiment" around these stocks.

Make data available to the frontend

## Frontend

Duno, some react thing to display what to buy along with some memes for user acceptance testing.

P.S Serious contributers only please, this is an extremely serious tool
